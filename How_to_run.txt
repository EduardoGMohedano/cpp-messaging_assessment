##### CPP Messaging asessment #####

I have added a makefile so that the application can be compiled into an executable called main
it also contains a recipe to clean the built application.


Solution:

The user can trigger the application and start feeding the app by using standard input until you press Ctrl+d,
once done the requested messages are printed in the following order: 

1 . Messages from std input
2 . Messages shuffled, in order to print the messages in this order I added the method print_messages_unordered() which won't affect the vector of messages
3 . Messages reordered after calling the method print_messages()
